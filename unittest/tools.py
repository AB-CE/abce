""" This file contains functions to compare floating point variables to 0. All
variables in this simulation as in every computer programm are floating
point variables. Floating point variables are not exact. Therefore var_a == var_b
has no meaning. Further a variable that is var_c = 9.999999999999966e-30 is for our
purpose equal to zero, but var_c == 0 would lead to False.
:meth:`is_zero`, :meth:`is_positive` and :meth:`is_negative` work
around this problem by defining float epsilon and determine whether the variable is
sufficiently close to zero or not.

This file also defines the :exc:`tools.NotEnoughGoods`
