Retrieval of the simulation results
===================================

Agents can log their internal states and the simulation can create
panel data. :mod:`abce.database`.

the results are stored in a subfolder of the ./results/ folder.

The tables are stored as '.csv' files which can be opened with excel and
libreoffice.

The same data is also as a sqlite3 database 'database.db' available.
It can be opened by 'sqlitebrowser' in ubuntu.
