Welcome to ABCE's documentation!
================================

ABCE is a Python Agent-Based Complete Economy Platform, written by Davoud Taghawi-Nejad.
The impatient reader can jump directly to the 'walk through', which explains how to
set up a simulation. In the walk through you learn
how to set up an agent and how to trade with other agents. The households and firms
classes allow you to produce with different production functions and consume with according
production functions.

ABCE runs an Mac, Windows and Linux.
