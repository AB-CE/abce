ABCE is a Python Agent-Based Complete Economy Platform, written by Davoud Taghawi-Nejad.
With ABCE, you can write economic, agent-based simulations in python. ABCE handles,
trading production an consumption automatically. The agents, written by the modeler
do only have to make the decisions and instruct the platform to trade, produce and
consume. ABCE makes sure the economy is closed, that means no goods appear, disappear
or are otherwise unaccounted for. It is therefore particularly useful for macro models.
ABCE's model output are compatible with R, Excel and sqlite.
