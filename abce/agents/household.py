        utility function.

        A utility_function, has to be set before see
        py:meth:`~abceagent.Household.create_cobb_douglas_utility_function` or
        manually; see example.

        Args:

            utility_function:
                A function that takes goods as parameters and returns
                a utility or returns (utility, left_over_dict). Where left_over_dict is
                a dictionary of all goods that are not completely consumed

            input goods dictionary or list:
                dictionary containing the amount of input good used consumed or
                a list of all goods that get completely consumed.
        Raises:
            NotEnoughGoods: This is raised when the goods are insufficient.

        Returns:
            The utility as a number. To log it see example.

        Example::

            def utility_function(car, cookies, bike):
