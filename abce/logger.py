The :class:`abceagent.Agent` class is the basic class for creating your agent. It automatically handles the
possession of goods of an agent. In order to produce/transforme goods you need to also subclass
the :class:`abceagent.Firm` [1]_ or to create a consumer the :class:`abceagent.Household`.

For detailed documentation on:

Trading:
    see :class:`abceagent.Trade`
Logging and data creation:
    see :class:`abceagent.Database` and :doc:`simulation_results`
Messaging between agents:
    see :class:`abceagent.Messaging`.

.. autoexception:: abcetools.NotEnoughGoods

.. [1] or :class:`abceagent.FirmMultiTechnologies` for simulations with complex technologies.
